In this project, we developed a machine learning model to predict stock market prices using historical data. The dataset consists of features such as opening price, high price, low price, volume, and date. We utilized Python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The model, based on linear regression, was trained on the historical data to predict the closing price of stocks. Mean squared error was used as the evaluation metric to assess the model's performance. The project concluded with visualizing the actual versus predicted stock prices using matplotlib.
